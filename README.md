This is a coronavirus application built in ReactJs, styled with TailwindCSS and deployed to Netlify.
The application uses the Coronavirus COVID19 API from Postman which is available at [https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10808728/SzS8rjbc#27454960-ea1c-4b91-a0b6-0468bb4e6712]
The main link we will use to fetch our JSON data is [https://api.covid19api.com/summary] and we will fetch our data using Axios which is an npm package that you can use in place of the default fetch API in the browser.
